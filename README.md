ARIMA stands for (AR- autoregressive) (I - integrated) (M- Moving) (A- average) .
ARIMA helps us to forecast or predict we trends based on the historical data. 
So i chose the topic for predicting unemployment rate , that can happen if there is a recession in 2025, similar to recession in 2009. 
Although it is a very basic code, i just used the interest rates for the forecasting,
we must always remember that there are many other factors that effect unemployment rate. 
The intention of my code is to just provide an basic understanding for the ARIMA model.
Anyway, happy Reading :)
